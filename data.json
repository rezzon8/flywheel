In a world of possibilities, knowing what to go after is less clear than ever and organisations need to experiment more to find the things that will work, this includes:</p><ul><li>Moving away from making gut feel decisions about the products we create and start using data and insight to inform our thinking.&nbsp;</li><li>Figuring out which ideas are most viable and feasible to deliver to meet our business goals, whilst removing some of the risk.</li><li>Getting feedback early and iterating, so we can ensure our investment is worth continuing or stop if it&rsquo;s unlikely to work for users or us.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong><br /><strong>Create a culture of test and learn within your organisation, and embrace experimentation as a part of problem solving. You want to design the quickest, simplest and least expensive experiment you can, to learn what you need to know.</strong></p><p>By starting with assumptions and insights from research, you can create a set of hypotheses to test. How you choose to test and experiment will depend on what stage your product or service is at. The critical part is being able to measure and gather evidence to prove or disprove your thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>At Alpha or early concept stage of a product you can create prototypes to test. By their very nature they are imperfect and throw away, enabling you to gather the feedback without a huge investment, and users are often happy to critique something less polished. These can be used to gather qualitative feedback to steer the direction of any iteration and next steps. You might test a number of different prototypes to see which performs best. This is useful for testing concepts early to see what resonates, and what really doesn&rsquo;t. Being willing to drop an idea at this stage is key.</p><p>In Beta or product development, prototypes can become higher fidelity and more refined, getting you closer to your target experience. User research at this stage will involve usability testing and focus on getting the detail right, be that content, interaction or functionality. There may be several rounds of iteration. A proof of concept or tech spike could be a better way to test a hypothesis, especially where you want to prove feasibility and understand constraints..</p><p>Alongside developing new products or services, you&rsquo;ll be considering new ideas for existing products. This could be refinements and improvements to an established experience. Start with data, understand the pain points for the user and the performance data for the product (registration, conversion, completion, time spent, drop out rate etc). If the data is not available or accessible, go back a step and fix that before progressing. There are no experiments without data. On live products consider A/B testing to compare and contrast results, or try Multi-variant testing. Both of these options will give you quantitative data to base your decisions on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Examples:</strong><br />DWP, Pret, HMRC,&nbsp;</p>",

Deciding which idea to invest in and develop can be a difficult step and we see organisation dealing with these scenarios.</p><ul><li>I know what I think the solution is already, but want buy in / budget  from across my organisation and key stakeholders. </li><li>Our key stakeholder has a solution in mind, but I want to base our thinking on our users and  use insight to uncover new opportunities and ideas.</li><li>We have a technical opportunity, but we're not sure what to use it for or how we can leverage this functionality to help our users.</li></ul><p><strong>Recommendation: <br/> Seek diversity in your thinking,  go wide and create an environment for collaborative, divergent thinking.</strong></p><p>By this we mean thinking beyond what you already came up with; inviting fresh perspectives and exploring the novel and 'what if'.  This requires both an investment of time and an open mind. We would recommend design sprints as an efficient and valuable way to generate ideas in a collaborative way, at pace,  and encourage people to build on each others' ideas in a non competitive way.</p><p>This method is underpinned by user research and insights; competitor analysis and clear business goals, leading the group to focus on the most important and valuable problems to solve.  Design sprints involve intensive, highly facilitated sessions with a blend of participants including key stakeholders, all focussed on problem solving. This results in early buy in for the ideas taken forward, due to the collaborative nature of the process;  and a deeper understanding of what we want to achieve.</p><p>This also provides an opportunity to think about how your ideas fit with your values, this could be related to social responsibility and sustainability or thinking about the impact ideas might have on other workers within the organisations, or how you will use customer data ethically and transparently to achieve this. Taking a moment to carefully evaluate will protect you from unexpected consequences later on.</p><p>Embedding and valuing creative processes like design sprints can set the stage for how to do collaborative problem solving across the business, creating a culture where everyone can have ideas and contribute to ongoing innovation.</p><p><strong>Examples</strong> <br /> The Very Group, SAP, DWP</p>",
